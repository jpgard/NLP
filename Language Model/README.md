#Language Model

The script included here develops and evaluates a language model using a Hidden Markov Model. The language models include uni-, bi-, and trigram models built on the Brown corpus in NLTK. The final model implements linear interpolation across the three n-gram models. Parts of this model were also implemented to build an HMM-based POS tagger that is not included here.
