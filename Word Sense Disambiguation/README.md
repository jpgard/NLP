#Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) Using Vector Space Model (VSM)

The scripts in this repository are used to develop a WSD system based on the Vector Model with supervised learning algorithms. They use feature extraction methods to enhance the WSD system.

Specifically, these scripts are used to create, train, and evaluate a WSD system using the SENSEVAL corpus based on the vector space model VSM. They utilize scikit-learn for machine learning, and WordNet for word sense and word similarity features. The system is implemented in English, Spanish, and Catalan.
