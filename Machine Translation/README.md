#Machine Translation

The script included in A.py is an implementation of IBM Models 1 and 2 to build a German-English translation system (A.py) using the Comtrans corpus. 

B.py is a from-scratch implementation of the Berkeley Aligner, which builds two models and using the EM algorithm and maximizes the combined probability across the two models.
